Matlab code to calculate the factor of safety for different materials underwater.

This code solves the Von Mises stress equations before comparing them to the tensile stress of each material to get its corresponding factor of safety. 

The materials simulated are:
  1- Stainless steel
  2- Aluminum
  3- Polyethylene (HDPE)
  4- Polypropylene (PP)

Results analysis:
  A factor of safety of 1 means that the structure is safe under its current loading conditions, while a factor of safety of 2 means it can withstand twice its current loading, ...
